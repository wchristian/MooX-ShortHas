=head1 SYNOPSIS

Instead of:

    use Moo;
    
    has hro => is => ro => required => 1;
    has hlazy => is => lazy => builder => sub { 2 };
    has hrwp => is => rwp => required => 1;
    has hrw => is => rw => required => 1;

You can now write:

    use Moo;
    use MooX::ShortHas;
    
    ro "hro";
    lazy hlazy => sub { 2 };
    rwp "hrwp";
    rw "hrw";

And options can be added or overriden by appending them:

    ro hro_opt => required => 0;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Moo>'s C<has> asks developers to repeat themselves a lot to set up attributes,
and since its inceptions the most common configurations of attributes have
crystallized through long usage.

This module provides sugar shortcuts that wrap around has under the appropriate
names to reduce the effort of setting up an attribute to naming it with a
shortcut.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 ro, rwp, rw

These three work the same, they convert a call like this:

    ro $name => @extra_args;

To this corresponding has call:
    
    has $name => is => ro => required => 1 => @extra_args;

The appending of extra args  makes it easy to override the required if
necessary.

=head2 lazy

This one is slightly different than the others, as lazy arguments don't require
a constructor value, but almost always want a builder of some kind:

    lazy $name => @extra_args;

Corresponds to:
    
    has $name => is => lazy => builder => @extra_args;

The first extra argument is thus expected to be any of the values appropriate
for the builder option.
